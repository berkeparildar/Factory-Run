# Factory Run

Factory Run is an exhilarating endless runner game that takes heavy inspiration from popular games like Subway Surfers. In Factory Run, players control a character who continuously runs forward through an industrial setting. The objective is to navigate between three columns or roads, avoiding obstacles and collecting coins to achieve the highest score possible. The game features dynamically changing platforms, with some segments randomly elevated, challenging players to jump to the higher platform. Gaps can also appear on elevated platforms, requiring precise jumps to avoid falling.
